VIP stands for [veDAO Improvement Proposal]. A VIP is a design document providing information to the veDAO community about a proposed change to the DAO. The author builds consensus within the community and documents dissenting opinions.


### GOVERNANCE STEPS

Below shows a high-level view of the veDAO governance process:
 
#### **Stage 1: Gauge Interest**
If you have an idea for improving veDAO protocol, the first stage is to test the waters. Go to veDAO on [Discord] and look for the Governance > #discussion channel. Share your idea and listen to what the community has to say.
If the initial reactions are positive and encouraging, start formalizing your idea into a post for polling on Discourse.

#### **Stage 2: Poll on Discourse**
Go to [Discourse], look for the Proposals category, and post your proposal there (use this template).
 
Tips on posting proposals on Discourse: 

Submit your ideas here for improving veDao in any way. New pools, new features, updating pool parameters, etc. All proposals are welcome here!

When creating new post make sure you:

* Stick to the specified template.
* Write a concise title with no number. The number will be added by mods once Snapshot voting starts.
* Add understandable AKA non-tech AKA ELI5 summary.
* Add an abstract: what will be done if the VIP is implemented (keep it below 200 words).
* Write a longer motivation with links and references if necessary.
* Formulate clear for and against positions.
* Include a poll to measure sentiment (public, results on vote).
* Don’t rush with putting a proposal on Snapshot

Template for your post: [Link]​

Check if your post has:

* **Sections**: Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation, Specification
* **Poll**: Include a min 24h poll (using the most appropriate poll type, typically Y/N or multiple choice)
All set! Last step is to ping a veDAO Team Member in Discord so we can publicize your work

#### **Stage 3: Vote on Snapshot**
If the Discourse poll passes, the VIP editor will step in to formalize the VIP. The voting process comprises:

Creating a vote on Snapshot (by VIP editor)  
Creating a specific discussion channel on Discord (veDAO mod)  
Announcing the vote on all socials (veDAO team)  
Voting period (currently 24 hours)

#### **Stage 4: Execution**
A veDAO Team Member or VIP editor will coordinate with the [community multisig] to execute the proposed change.


### GOVERNANCE ROLES

The stakeholders for the governance process can be both internal and external. Various governance roles exist to ensure the stakeholders engage in delivering the type of value desired or expected. The key roles and responsibilities of veDAO governance are:
VIP Editor
Broadly, the VIP editor’s powers and responsibilities are:
Checks the incoming proposals for quality
Check language and grammar, and other editorial aspects
Work with the VIP authors for revision, where required
Create vote on Snapshot
The editors don’t pass on judgement on VIPs, rather act as an administrative check-and-balance role.
Who: The current editors are ….


VeDAO Team Members
Team member powers and responsibilities:
Provide feedback on proposals
Advise on how best to create a passing proposal
Create channels and shepherd discussions in Discord and Discourse
Post announcements of voting start on social channels (Discord, TG, Twitter)
Who: Anyone with a veDAO Team role in Discord

This is the suggested template for new VIPs. Note that an VIP number will be assigned by an editor. 

#### Simple Summary

"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.

#### Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what will be done if the VIP is implemented, not why it should be done or how it will be done. If the VIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".

#### Motivation
This is the problem statement. This is the why of the VIP. It should clearly explain why the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain why the change is needed.

#### Specification
Overview
This is a high level overview of how the VIP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.

#### Rationale
This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Why did you propose to implement the change in this way, what were the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
